Week 3 Javascript: Password Generator

I have created a password generator that can create strong password that provides greater security.
This also includes special characters and gives you the ability to copy directly into clipboard.

User instructions:
GIVEN I need a new, secure password

WHEN I open the website, there is a pop-up confirmation
THEN I am presented with a series of confirms for password criteria
WHEN I click the 'OK' button 
THEN I will be led to html document and may tickbox necessary criteria
WHEN I click input textbox
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password from lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters selection
WHEN I criteria have all been completed
THEN my selections should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN I press button, "Generate Password"
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is written to the page
WHEN I password is visible on page
THEN I can press button, "Copy password to clipboard"
WHEN I press button, "Copy password to clipboard"
THEN I can paste the generated password anywhere needed
